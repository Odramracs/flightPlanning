sample
The first line denotes the total number of data rows in the file. Each subsequent row contains two city
names, the flight cost, and the flight duration, separated by a pipe symbol.

requested
The first line specifies the number of flight plans requested. Subsequent lines consist of pipe-delimited
city pairs followed by a trailing character indicating sorting preference for the output flights by time (T) or
cost (C). Your solution will identify all flight paths between these cities (if any exist) and calculate the total
cost and time spent in the air.



based on the flights given (the graph), need to create an adjacentcy list
to hold the data and which flights can go to eachother. Then need an algo to
have inputs from one city to another to then find the paths from each
